__I am a PhD candidate and teaching assistant in the Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Scientific Computing (AMSC) program at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Dr. Jacob Wenegrat](https://wenegrat.github.io).__

Currently, my research focuses on boundary exchange and mixing from breaking internal waves on sloping topography, using Large Eddy Simulations (LES). I studied Applied Mathematics at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, while working at the [Joint Applied Math and Marine Sciences Fluids Lab](https://amath.unc.edu/research/fluid-mechanics/fluids-lab/) until 2019. Broadly, I am interested in numerical applications of ocean dynamics, particularly in the ocean submesoscale and interactions with topography and am driven by a passion for connecting mathematical and computational concepts to the natural world.
