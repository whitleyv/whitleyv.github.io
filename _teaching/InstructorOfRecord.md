As the instructor of record for these lower level math courses, I planned lessons, group work, quizzes, and worksheets to help 60-80 non-mathmatically inclined students understand the required material. This included both in-person and virtual environments. Some classes required managing three different course timelines within one class, as well as supervising a team of undergraduate assistants in the classroom.
